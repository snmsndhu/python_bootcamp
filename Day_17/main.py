###### Creating Classes #######

#How we can create a class

#Syntax looks very simple

class User:
#Note word pass is used here to pass the Indent error, it is not a part of creating class.
    pass

#That all we need to create a class
#Now we will use our class to create a object.

user_1 = User()

#For the name a class we have to use the PascalCase
"""
So what is the PascalCase ?
First letter capital of the single word.

There are other two naming conventions.

camelCase
snake_case

it is same as the i wrote there names, that is the way to name them

in python camelCase is rarely used.
For everything else, rather then the CLASS, snake_case is used.

#So next thing is how we can create Attributes in the class

##Attritutes are basically a variable.

"""
To do that we have to use the constructor.
So how can use the constructor?
