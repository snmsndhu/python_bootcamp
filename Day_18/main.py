from turtle import *

#It will import everything from the turtle
#But this method is not used that much
#To import the whole module we can just it do like that

import turtle

#this is the best way to import the whole module

#or if you just want to import one single method you can just import a single item

from turtle import Turtle

#this is the way import a single method from a module

#How we can remain a module in our files

import turtle as t
