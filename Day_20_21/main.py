"""
In building this game we will cover a new topic which is CLASS inheritance,
which means CLASS can inherit from another classes, which will improve 
our OOP knowledge.
We can inherit our Class methods in the new Class.

How the syntax will look like =>

class Fish(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
       super().__init__()

Over here we are inherting from the Class Animal in the Fish Class.
and we have to add super().__init__() inside the Class to inherit all the attribute
and the methods of the Animal Class in the Fish Class.
