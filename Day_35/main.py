What is API Authentication ?

It is basically the APIs keys that are paid not free or we have to get authentication,
in order to use them.
Every Authentication has a free plan to learn about and for their sake of safety, 
so that anybody can not use their free plan on big scale.

They provide API keys.

What are the API Keys ?

This is most likely your personal accound number or password. This is the way by API provide can track,
how much you are using their API key and they can deny your access over your limit.

What are the Environment Variables ?

It is basically the saving the important variables in the different location.
By using dotenv files.
